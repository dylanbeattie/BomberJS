	<h2>How The Game Works</h2>
	<p>The server runs an instance of BomberServer.</p>
	<p>BomberServer contains exactly one BomberGame. A BomberGame represents the current 
		state of a particular game, where state is defined as:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">A collection of players, each responsible for its&#39; own 
		state</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">The current state of the level (terrain, power-ups)</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">The game scores</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">A player&#39;s state is the player&#39;s LOCATION and VELOCITY.</p>
	<p>Each connected client runs a timing loop, and <b>each client is the source of 
		truth for that player</b>. This is naive from a security perspective because 
		clients can be spoofed, but we don&#39;t care about that right now.</p>
	<p>Events</p>
	<p>Events happen on the client, in response to user input or gameplay. They&#39;re sent 
		to the server, which broadcasts them to all other clients.</p>
	<p>When an event is broadcast, we&#39;ll also transmit certain &quot;snapshot&quot; data about the 
		state of the game, to keep multiple clients in sync.</p>
	<p>Events are JSON objects encoded as:</p>
	<pre>{
    type: [string],
    data: [json-data]
}</pre>
	<p>where the JSON-data varies with the event type.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>join-game</dt>
		<dd style="margin-left: 40px">A client has connected to the game. The server needs 
			to send them the current game state (map, players, and scores), a spawn 
			location, a color, and a player ID. The client should draw the map based on the 
			game state, spawn the new player at the specified location, and start listening 
			for events.</dd>
		<dd style="margin-left: 40px">
			<br />
			<b>Format: { type: &#39;join-game&#39;, data: { player: [player], game: [game] }}</b></dd>
		<dt></dt>
		<dt>change-direction</dt>
		<dd>A client has started or stopped moving, or changed the direction they&#39;re moving 
			in. Raised in response to input events (keypresses), and collisions (client 
			running into walls, arena limits, or hitting another player)<br />
			<br />
			<b>Format: { type: &#39;changed-direction&#39;, data { player: [player] } }</b></dd>
		<dt>drop-bomb</dt>
		<dd style="margin-left: 40px">A client has dropped a bomb. Event must encode the 
			location where the bomb was dropped.</dd>
		<dt>bomb-explodes</dt>
		<dd>A bomb dropped by a client has exploded. Event must encode which bomb it is.</dd>
		<dt>player-died</dt>
		<dd>Each client is responsible for detecting whether an explosion has killed the 
			player and notifying the server when this occurs. Bombs don&#39;t move, and death is 
			caused by proximity - so it makes sense to use the local client state to decide 
			whether a player&#39;s died or not.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Each client must listen for the following events transmitted by the server:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>player-joined</dt>
		<dd>A new player has joined the game. Data will encode the new player&#39;s name, color, 
			ID and spawn point.<br />
			<br />
			<b>{ type: &#39;player-joined&#39;, data: { id: player.id, color: player.color, 
			position: player.position, name: player.name} }</b></dd>
		<dt>game-init</dt>
		<dd>The clients&#39; request to join the server was accepted. Data contains the initial 
			game state.</dd>
		<dt>player-changed-direction</dt>
		<dd>A player changed direction (or stopped moving). This will also include the map 
			coordinates where the change happened, and so provides syncing of client/server 
			state.</dd>
		<dt>bomb-dropped</dt>
		<dd>A player dropped a bomb. The client must draw a bomb at the specified 
			coordinates and start the countdown timing loop.</dd>
		<dt></dt>
		<dd></dd>
